<!-- Message if institute is not withdrawn -->

    Please provide the public address and human readable name for the educational entity which you would like to add to the blockchain.
    If the public address is already known the entity will be renamed to the new public name you provide.
    The entity you add can endorse badges and badgeclasses as long as it is not withdrawn.

<!-- Message if institute is withdrawn -->
<p i18n *ngIf="this.validanaService.getLastKnownWithdrawn() === true">
    Your institution has been withdrawn. Therefore you can not add entities.
    All current entities for your institution have been disabled and can not endorse badges or badgeclasses.
